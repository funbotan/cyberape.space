Title: What is this site?
Lang: en
Slug: about

If I had to pick one topic upon which to build everything else, I'd take predicting the future. Not merely making up scenarios, but searching for the most probable ones. To even bring this topic up, one has to understand science, because it makes the future possible; history, because it tends to repeat itself; politics and economics, because they steer society; math, because it rules everything else.

«Cyber ape» just happens to be the most meaningful symbol I could come up with. It combines the inseparable connection of past and present, the unsolvable conflict between nature and civilization, the transition from natural to artificial evolution and whatever else your imagination can add.
